Welcome to ZDT Source Code Library!

ZDT has deployed a high-security, high-performance infrastructure based on block chains. On top of this architecture, developers can build and deploy other additional and scalable block chain architectures. At the same time, they can develop other distributed applications, such as games, payment, tourism, DAPPâ€¦

After ZDT source code was published, many pilot testers have run a part of private nodes for testing and developed many related applications. We believe that ZDT will have a broader application prospect in the future.
